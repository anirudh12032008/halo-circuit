# halo - Circuit

This is my spinning fan that shows in air 
It uses an Arduino nano, some leds, a motor, and a hall sensor,when it spins fast, you can show stuff on it
Im building it on a vero board because its a relatively simple pcb and I have never triedd working with vero boards

## What Does It Do?

It blinks the lights really fast while spinning so your eyes thinks that its all seeing at once 
It's like a hologram but made with blinking LEDs

---

##  Why Did I Make It?

Because itâ€™s super cool and I love holograms and its too cheap to build 

---

## How It Works

A magnet tells the Arduino when the circle starts with the hall sensor then it blinks the LED in a special pattern every spin to show the content
